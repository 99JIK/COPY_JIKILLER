> A Powerful, GUI-based Plagiarism Checker for Programming Assignments.

**COPY_JIKILLER** is a robust desktop application designed to efficiently check for plagiarism in students' code submissions. Going beyond simple text comparison, it utilizes advanced analysis based on [AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)](#-what-is-ast-analysis) to precisely detect various types of plagiarism, including changes in variable names, code order, and more.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Multi-Language [AST](#-what-is-ast-analysis) Analysis**: Supports advanced AST-based analysis for **Python, C/C++, and Java** to effectively detect plagiarism where variable or function names have been altered.
* **Side-by-Side Diff Viewer**: Double-clicking a result opens a new window displaying the two codes side-by-side, with matching parts highlighted for intuitive comparison.
* **Flexible Scan Options**: Provides various options such as recursive subdirectory search, extension filtering, and an adjustable similarity threshold.
* **Convenient & Modern UI**: Ensures a pleasant user experience with a progress bar, ETA, a stop function, and CSV export capabilities. Supports both light and dark modes, automatically detecting the system's theme on first launch.

## üöÄ Detailed User Guide

### 1. üìÅ Folder Selection & Basic Setup

> This is the first step to begin a scan.

* **Select Folder**: Click the `[Select Folder]` button to choose the directory containing the code files you want to check. This will enable the 'Start Scan' button and lock the settings.
* **Include Subfolders**: When checked, the scan will recursively search through all subdirectories within the selected folder.
* **Extension Filter**: Use the `[Select Extensions]` dropdown menu to toggle which file extensions to check. You can add new extensions with the `[‚ûï]` button or manage (delete) custom extensions with the `[...]` button.

### 2. ‚öôÔ∏è Analysis Mode & Threshold

> Set the accuracy and criteria for your scan.

* **Analysis Mode**:
  * **Basic Analysis (Text)**: Compares plain text after removing comments and whitespace. It's universally applicable to all languages but has the lowest accuracy.
  * **Python/C++/Java (AST)**: Performs AST analysis for the respective language. This method analyzes the code's structure, making it highly effective at catching plagiarism. **It is strongly recommended to select the mode that matches the language of the code being scanned.**
* **Similarity Threshold**: Adjust the slider to set the minimum similarity percentage (%) for results to be displayed. (Default: 70%)

### 3. ‚úîÔ∏è Running & Stopping the Scan

> Start the scan after completing the setup.

* **Start Scan**: Click the `[‚úîÔ∏è Start Scan]` button to lock the settings and begin the scan.
* **Check Progress**: The status bar at the bottom will display the progress percentage, processed item count, and ETA in real-time. On Windows, the progress is also shown on the taskbar icon.
* **Stop**: Click the `[‚ùå Stop]` button at any time to immediately halt the ongoing scan.

### 4. üìä Viewing & Analyzing Results

> Intuitively check for suspected plagiarism.

* **Results List**: After the scan is complete, pairs of files exceeding the set threshold will be listed in descending order of similarity.
* **Diff Viewer**: **Double-click** an item in the list to open a new side-by-side comparison window. The matching parts of the two codes will be highlighted.

<!-- GIF Placeholder: Demonstrates viewing results and using the Diff Viewer. -->
<!-- ![GIF-Demo-4](../resource/demo_04_results.gif) -->

### 5. üíæ Exporting & Saving Settings

> Save your analysis results and preserve your current settings.

* **Export Results**: Click the `[üíæ Export Results]` button to save all items currently displayed in the results list to a **CSV file**.
* **Auto-Save Settings**: The last used **theme, language, and extension filter list** are automatically saved when you close the program and will be restored on the next launch.

## üî¨ What is AST Analysis?
AST stands for **"Abstract Syntax Tree"**.

Instead of viewing code as a simple sequence of characters, an AST represents its grammatical structure (like variable declarations, loops, conditionals, etc.) in a tree-like format, much like a compiler does.

**COPY_JIKILLER**'s AST analysis mode uses this principle to compare the **core logic and structure of the code itself**, ignoring superficial aspects like variable/function names, comments, and whitespace. This makes it highly effective at detecting plagiarism attempts, such as simply renaming variables or reordering code blocks.

## üì¶ Building and Distribution
You can build the project into a single executable file for easy distribution.

### 1. Build the Application

1.  **Install PyInstaller**: `pip install pyinstaller`
2.  **Run the Build Command**:
    * Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and run the command appropriate for your OS.
    * The **`--add-data`** option is crucial for bundling all necessary resources (icons, images, guides) into the `.exe` file.
    * The **`--add-binary`** option is required to bundle the C/C++ AST analysis feature.

<br>

#### ü™ü **Windows**
* Find the path to your `libclang.dll` file (e.g., `C:\Program Files\LLVM\bin\libclang.dll`).
* Replace the example path in the command below with your actual path.
```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name "COPY_JIKILLER" --icon="resource/copy_jikiller.ico" --add-data "resource;resource" --add-data "guide;guide" --add-binary "C:\Program Files\LLVM\bin\libclang.dll;." main.py
```

#### üçè **macOS**
* Find the path to your `libclang.dylib` file (e.g., `/opt/homebrew/lib/libclang.dylib` if installed with Homebrew).
* Replace the example path in the command below with your actual path.
```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name "COPY_JIKILLER" --icon="resource/copy_jikiller.ico" --add-data "resource:resource" --add-data "guide:guide" --add-binary "/path/to/your/libclang.dylib:." main.py
```

#### üêß **Linux**
* Find the path to your `libclang.so` file (e.g., `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libclang.so.1`).
* Replace the example path in the command below with your actual path.
```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name "COPY_JIKILLER" --icon="resource/copy_jikiller.ico" --add-data "resource:resource" --add-data "guide:guide" --add-binary "/path/to/your/libclang.so:." main.py
```

### 2. Distribute the Application

1.  After a successful build, a single executable file named **`COPY_JIKILLER.exe`** (or `.app` on macOS) will be created inside the `dist` folder.
2.  To share the program with others, **you only need to send this single `.exe` file**.
3.  Users can run the program by double-clicking the received file, and all icons and images will be displayed correctly.

### 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting: Icon Not Appearing on Windows

If the built `.exe` file's icon appears as the default icon in the taskbar or File Explorer, it's most likely due to Windows' **Icon Cache**. Follow these steps to reset it:

1.  **Open Command Prompt as Administrator**:
    * Press `Win` key, type `cmd`, right-click on **'Command Prompt'**, and select **[Run as administrator]**.

2.  **Terminate Explorer**:
    * In the admin command prompt, type the following command and press `Enter`. (Your desktop and taskbar will temporarily disappear, which is normal).
    ```bash
    taskkill /f /im explorer.exe
    ```

3.  **Delete Icon Cache Files**:
    * Now, type the following two commands, pressing `Enter` after each one.
    ```bash
    cd %userprofile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer
    del iconcache* /a
    ```

4.  **Restart Explorer**:
    * Finally, type the command below to bring back your desktop and taskbar.
    ```bash
    explorer.exe
    ```
5.  Navigate to the `dist` folder and check if the `.exe` file's icon is now displayed correctly.
